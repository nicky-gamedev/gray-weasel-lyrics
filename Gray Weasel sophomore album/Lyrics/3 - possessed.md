[verse]
your eyes are like black holes
you didn't blink a single time
you hit me again and scream
i'm worried that someone hurts you

you lurk me into giving what i dont have
lurk me into writing my own calvary
hours later i dont recognize you
and all i feel is guilt and misery

[chorus]
i wish you could stop poking your nose
where no one wants you well
and coming home feeling possessed
expecting me to do a priest work

[verse]
your eyes are full of tears
flooding from memories that feel fake
im bruised and with no energy to deal
you beg me the devil is long gone

you know the right amount of hope
to give me before taking it back
i live in constant oscilation since then
and i know you too.

[chorus]
i wish you could stop poking your nose
where no one wants you well
and coming home feeling possessed
expecting me to do a priest work

[outro]
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore 
i dont recognize you anymore
