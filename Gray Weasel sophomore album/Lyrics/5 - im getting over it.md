the absence of your voice in this quiet room disturbs my focus on anything
everything i do for myself is a little trick you taught me with a kiss
and being lonely is not so fun anymore, i wanna be with you
but i'll be getting over with it.

the thought of you never coming back is making me late for everything else
everything i do for myself is a survival instinct you insisted me to have
and being lonely hurts so much now, i wanna be with you
but i'll be getting over with it

and i need to
and i want to
and i need to
and i want to

the sheer memory of you doing anything on our bed makes me loose my sleep
everything i do for myself is a reaction to the exaustion your departure gave me
and being lonely is just a reminder of how i'll expend the rest of my life
but i'll be getting over with it

the people around me coping with my loss makes me think about you
everything i do for myself is just a way to honor what i remember of you
and being lonely is just a trigger for crying and suffering for your loss
but i'll be getting over with it

and i need to
and i want to
and i need to
and i want to

i need to take care of myself but i still dont know how to live without you
everything i do for myself is just a pressure to be functional and happy
and being lonely is just a feeling i constantly avoid the worst way possible
but i'll be getting over with it

i want to feel the flowers growing and the sun shining again but only you did that
everything i do for myself is just a bad way of dealing with your loss
and being lonely is just a constant waste of potential time we could have had.
but i'll be getting over with it

and i need to
and i dont want to
but i need to
and i need to
