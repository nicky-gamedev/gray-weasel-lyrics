i watch the moon light the street i am
below UV lamps i sit in the sidewalk
trying to make sense
trying to feel anything

swollen by a big monster i stay
digesting in its invisible belly
while pieces of me are delivered
in trucks full of meat

i used to shine, i used to smile
i used to do drawings and be proud
but i've died somewhere and
my body kept going

and everytime i think about dying
i feel alive again

my shattered heart pieces cut my feet
as i walked barefoot to your room
trying to reconcile
trying to make sense

theres nothing left to say
i only feel like running away
but i have nowhere to run
all my routes are blocked

i used to fight, i used to impose
