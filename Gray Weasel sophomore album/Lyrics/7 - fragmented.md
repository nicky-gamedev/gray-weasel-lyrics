i watch the moon light the street i am
below UV lamps i sit in the sidewalk
trying to make sense
trying to feel anything

swollen by a big monster i stay
digesting in its invisible belly
while pieces of me are delivered
in trucks full of meat

i used to shine, i used to smile
i used to do drawings and be proud
but i've died somewhere and
my body kept going

and everytime i think about dying
i feel alive again

my shattered heart pieces cut my feet
as i walked barefoot to your room
trying to reconcile
trying to make sense

theres nothing left to say
i only feel like running away
but i have nowhere to run
all my routes are blocked

i used to fight, i used to impose
i used to write songs and be proud
but there's nothing left anymore
just an empty shell

and everytime i think about dying
i feel alive again
and everytime i think about leaving
its you who makes me stay

and everywhere i look 
theres a piece of me
i already changed this place
and thats so hard to undo

as small as a flower in a garden
as big as a slaughtered queen
just keep changing your place
it's the small acts that make us immortal.
