capo 1 - verse:[G, Am, D, C]; chorus[G, Am, Em]; bridge: [Em with enfasis in the bass cords]

[verse 1]
everytime I'm in your arms 
i feel so guilty all the time 
feeling that I don't deserve 
feeling that I'm not worth it 

but what i feel with you is good 
and i need like the air i breathe 
but this feeling got the best of me 
and i hope that you understand, 

[chorus]
that everything that i feel is truth 
but my past keeps coming back a
nd making me such a creature 
i hate to say that 
but i love you but I can't be loved
because I'm so unlovable. 

[verse 2]
everytime you tell me I'm worth it 
i know that i misguided you
into thinking that i worth your love 
but i just don't, you will find out that

i want to marry you 
and i want to have kids with you
and they call me mother 
such a dream won't stand, 

[chorus]
but everything that i feel is truth 
but my past keeps coming back 
and making me such a creature
i hate to say that
but i love you but I can't be loved 
because I'm so unlovable. 

[outro]
and even though my heart 
weights my chest straight to hell 
i can't get away from you 
my love is a force 
and i wanted to be sure 
that i will never fail on you
