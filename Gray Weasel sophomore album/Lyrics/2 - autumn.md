autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

the summer comes, brings the heat
its so excessive i get so tired
but when the winter comes
i want so bad to feel the sweat again

this cycle repeats, every year
i wasn't made to live like this
but what is the other option?
im not strong enough to move the stars

so autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter

my shivery spine misses your sun
im tired of shaking and resting in blankets
i know the fire is long gone
there's nothing left to burn

autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter

and the curse of the weasel
still follows me
always in my shoulder
where i cant see.

and the curse of the weasel
still fucks me
whenever my heart is beating
it scratches the flesh away
