autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

the summer comes, brings the heat
its so excessive, i act strange


autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

i guess, it was just as planned
if I'm gonna live till 27
i need a brief moment of happiness
so i can feel the pain and miss everything 

i miss your voice on my ear
i miss the feel of your skin
i miss pillow talks by the morning 
just vanished away with no clues, so

autumn can come and kill me
I don't really care
there's no more nice things
in the winter for me

in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter for me
in the winter

and the curse of the weasel
still follows me
always in my shoulder
where i cant see.

and the curse of the weasel
still fucks me
whenever my heart is beating
it scratches the flesh away
