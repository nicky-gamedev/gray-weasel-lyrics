Devoided of meaning
Empty of life
I walk the corridors of this house

Trying to feel how they were
Something is killing me slowly
I think its myself

I wish i could blame you
Rage makes things faster
But we are so perfect

I dont get it, its sad
And if i overanalyze this
I will find lies that fit like a glove

So i look at myself
And all that i see
Is selfish and boring

I don't know how to heal myself
We are going to crash every night
Unless you leave me now and let me die

I know i've been bad for your health
These bites hurts and bleeding makes it worst
I wont run for the door to stop you again
Just go, go and leave me here.

I know i've been promising so much
These bites hurts and im showing to you
The damage it made, how deep it goes
I'm sorry i've bled all over you

I know we called names on each other
These bites hurts and they are not healing
I feel insecure broke and weak
Trying to survive i forgot how to live

I know this is tiring to hear
These bites hurts and yours too
Yours are new, made with familiar teeth
Sorry to meet you we'll be seeing again
