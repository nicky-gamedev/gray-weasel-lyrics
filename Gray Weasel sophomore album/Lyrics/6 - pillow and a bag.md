What bit you?Â 
Why are we foaming like this?
So carelessly
About our tinker made hearts

Stone with stone makes fire
And honey, This is already magma
We cant keep flinting our hearts
Until this place explodes

I miss the way you expected me
I miss the way you smiled to me
I miss the way you lost your breath
But now we both breath the same mold

But I still love you
And i dont want you to go
But i cant stand
Being a pillow and a bag
