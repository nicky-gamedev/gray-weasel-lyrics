[part one]
i breathe 
for the first time in my life 
i fill my lungs with the air 
of the street that shelters me 

I'm rich 
I'm full of love 
to give, to take to nurture, to starve 
to make a circle of good things 

I suffered 
A lot to reach this place 
All my tears left holes on the ground 
But this is over now.

I finally
Have the guts to open smile 
To feel the breeze cutting my face 
Bringing me whatever it carries

I will say 
That i feel so lucky now
That even the fear of losing this 
Can't hold me back

[part two]
I waited this for my whole life
And i can't deny the feeling now 
I reborn, I live, I feel the air 
I grow trees with my footsteps 

I waited this for my whole life 
And i can't deny the feeling now
I reborn, I live, I feel the air
I grow trees with my footsteps 

[part three]
Don't be scared, dive yourself. Find your love, fuck themselves
