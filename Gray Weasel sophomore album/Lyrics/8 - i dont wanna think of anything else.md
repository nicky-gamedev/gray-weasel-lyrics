like a flower i blossomed
to your shiny summer smile
and you hug me so tight
that the world feels so far
and the meaning of life
became overwritten by your name

and i dont wanna think of anything else
i'm yours, you're mine, we're love
i dont wanna think of anything else
i love, you love, we love

like a cat i purred
for the feelings i never felt
and you kiss me so tender
that the floor feels distant
and the concept of death
feels like a joke that never pays off

and i dont wanna think of anything else
i'm yours, you're mine, we're love
i dont wanna think of anything else
i love, you love, we love

and like a bride i dream
of the day i will see you in white
and we will live together for so long
that you will forget how lonely it was
and the concept of love
will change but never fade

and i dont wanna think of anything else
i'm yours, you're mine, we're love
i dont wanna think of anything else
i love, you love, we love

and i dont wanna think of anything else
i'm yours, you're mine, we're love
i dont wanna think of anything else
i love, you love, we love
i love, you love, we love
