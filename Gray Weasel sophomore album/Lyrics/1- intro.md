The **Weasel War Dance** is the term which refers to the behavior of an exited Weasel or Ferret. In the Wild, the dance may be used to confuse its prey. In Domestic Ferrets, the war dance is usually after the successful capture of a toy. It may consist of a series of sideways and backwards hops, often including an arched back and a chuckling sound or hissing noises and a fizzled tail. Domestic Ferrets are often very clumsy with their dance, and will ofter knock over lamps and other furniture. Although frightening, it is not dangerous to humans.
